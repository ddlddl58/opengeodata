description provided by authors:

The enclosed package represents radiation data collected with the fixed-wing aircraft (C-12) from 2 April 2011 to 9 May 2011. The data were collected with an array of large thallium activated sodium iodide (NaI(T)) crystals and associated readout electronics to produce time and location referenced measurements. These results represent raw data that have been calibrated to physical units and validated. They do not include any further evaluation.
