# DEMO ground radiation monitoring data from Mob-DOSE detector

## Measuring device ##

The data were measured using the Mob-DOSE (also called PDOSE-3) portable device, with native output in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec. Can be opened (and was also tested) using PEI software like [PEIView](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiview/) or [PEIConvert](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiconvert/).

"Equipped with two energy compensated Geiger Tubes, the device covers a wide range of measurements from 50nSv/h up to 400 mSv/h of GDER (Gamma-Dose Equivalent Rate)." (equipment description source -  [NUVIA Dynamics website](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/pdose-3/))

## About the data ##

- real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw pulses from both GM tubes etc.
- the radiation data are real but the location and time/date parameters were changed
- the device number (PDOSE666-9999) is fictional

## package 1 - Chateau Lednice park, Lednice, Czech Republic ##

- fictional measurement position [here](https://en.mapy.cz/s/pazezolepo)
- fictional measurement date and start time: 1.4.2019 1:14:19 GMT/UTC
- fictional measurement dose rate (DosL_NAI2_uGy/h) range (microSv/h): 0 - 0,0724 (in flight height, not recalculated to ground)

## package contents ##

Each package contains data from fictional measurement in particular area using the Mob-DOSE portable device, in PEI format.

Also contains "details" folder with exported PEI header and data in CSV and QGIS... folder with full project for [QGIS](https://qgis.org)  including styled point layer in [OGC GeoPackage standard format](https://www.geopackage.org).
