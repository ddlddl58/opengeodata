# DEMO Airborne gammaspectrometric data "Uluru"

## Measuring device ##

The data were measured using the Mob-DOSE (also called PDOSE-3) portable device, with native output in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec. Can be opened (and was also tested) using PEI software like [PEIView](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiview/) or [PEIConvert](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/peiconvert/).

"Equipped with two energy compensated Geiger Tubes, the device covers a wide range of measurements from 50nSv/h up to 400 mSv/h of GDER (Gamma-Dose Equivalent Rate)." (equipment description source -  [NUVIA Dynamics website](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/pdose-3/))

## About the data ##

- real data - all the radiation data incl. dose rate values, raw pulses from both GM tubes etc.
- the radiation data are real but the location and time/date parameters were changed
- the device number (PDOSE666-9999) is fictional

## package contents ##

Each package contains data from fictional measurement in particular area using the Mob-DOSE (1)(also called PDOSE-3) portable device, in PEI format defined by Pico Envirotec. Can be opened using PEI software like PEIView (2) or PEIConvert (3).

The radiation data are real but the location and time/date parameters were changed.

Also contains "details" folder with exported PEI header and data in CSV and QGIS... folder with full project for QGIS (4) including styled point layer in OGC GeoPackage standard format.
