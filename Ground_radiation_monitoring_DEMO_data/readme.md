# DEMO Airborne gammaspectrometric data "Uluru"

## Measuring device ##

The data were measured using IRIS airborne gamma-ray spectrometric system developed by Pico Envirotec Inc. Company in Toronto, Canada. Two boxes (Master and Slave), each box with 2 NaI(Tl) crystals with dimensions 10x10x40 cm were used. 

"Equipped with two energy compensated Geiger Tubes, the device covers a wide range of measurements from 50nSv/h up to 400 mSv/h of GDER (Gamma-Dose Equivalent Rate)." (equipment description source -  [NUVIA Dynamics website](http://picoenvirotec.com/enviro/pdose-3/))
