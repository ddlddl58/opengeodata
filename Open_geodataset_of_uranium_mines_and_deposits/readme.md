This is initial commit of the open dataset of uranium mines and deposits. 
Currently it contains data from Australia:

and few ones in Germany.
In future it is planned to be expanded with data from Germany, France and other countries.

The dataset is available in CSV format and also in OGC GeoPackage format (geodatabase with vector points) with style included so you can easily load it in your GIS software like QGIS for example.
